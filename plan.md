Week-by-week plan for the whole project. Update this as you go along.

## Winter semester

* **Week 1**
The plan for this week is to research about the different projects avaliable to me and get the choices down a top 8
* **Week 2**
The plan for this week is figure out the scope of the project and research about the current scene of computer vision. I will also try to get some framworks downloaded and implemented so I can play about with them and understand how they work
* **Week 3**
The plan for this week is to ideally complete my first draft literature review and continue research into the different algorithms avaliable. I want to also set myself up in the Google Collab enviroment and try and use its notebooks to implement the frameworks
* **Week 4**
The plan for this week is to implement another algorithm besides the viola jones algorithm and the MTCNN algorithm. I would like to set up an algortihm that used the DLIB face detector. This week I also want to continue my research on different algortihms (R-CNN and FaceNet) and move my literature review over to latex instead of word. I also want to come up with some experiments I can run using the current algorithms I have implemented.
* **Week 5**
 I also want to reasearch more into implementing the RetinaFace algortihm so that I will have 4 algorithms to work with. I also want to add more information to my literature review now that I know more. I also would like to come up with more experiments I could do.
* **Week 6**
I want to go over the RetinaFace paper with my supervisors help so I can better understand how it works. I also want to collate a dataset of faces that I can then annotate manually to obtain a ground truth for my experiments in future. I would like this ground truth to be presented in a common structure that would be easy to work with in python like a dictionary. I would like to also create a method for my collegues to annotate faces for me.
* **Week 7**
I want run all 4 of my algorithms and generate the corresponding dicionaries from them that contain the bounding box location and landmark locations. I would like to then calculate error distances between the ground truth and algorithm results so that I can start to analyse.
* **Week 8**
I would like to carry out more comparisons of the data I have received and start to create figures and graphs so that next week I can go over them with my advisor and see what direction to take the research and analysis in. I also want to update my github and get it caught up with all the work I have done.
* **Week 9**
* **Week 10**
* **Week 11 [PROJECT WEEK]**
* **Week 12 [PROJECT WEEK]** Status report submitted.
