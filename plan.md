Week-by-week plan for the whole project. Update this as you go along.

## Winter semester

* **Week 1**
The plan for this week is to research about the different projects avaliable to me and get the choices down a top 8
* **Week 2**
The plan for this week is figure out the scope of the project and research about the current scene of computer vision. I will also try to get some framworks downloaded and implemented so I can play about with them and understand how they work
* **Week 3**
The plan for this week is to ideally complete my first draft literature review and continue research into the different algorithms avaliable. I want to also set myself up in the Google Collab enviroment and try and use its notebooks to implement the frameworks
* **Week 4**
The plan for this week is to implement another algorithm besides the viola jones algorithm and the MTCNN algorithm. I would like to set up an algortihm that used the DLIB face detector. This week I also want to continue my research on different algortihms (R-CNN and FaceNet) and move my literature review over to latex instead of word. I also want to come up with some experiments I can run using the current algorithms I have implemented.
* **Week 5**
 I also want to reasearch more into implementing the RetinaFace algortihm so that I will have 4 algorithms to work with. I also want to add more information to my literature review now that I know more. I also would like to come up with more experiments I could do.
* **Week 6**
I want to go over the RetinaFace paper with my supervisors help so I can better understand how it works. I also want to collate a dataset of faces that I can then annotate manually to obtain a ground truth for my experiments in future. I would like this ground truth to be presented in a common structure that would be easy to work with in python like a dictionary. I would like to also create a method for my collegues to annotate faces for me.
* **Week 7**
I want run all 4 of my algorithms and generate the corresponding dicionaries from them that contain the bounding box location and landmark locations. I would like to then calculate error distances between the ground truth and algorithm results so that I can start to analyse.
* **Week 8**
I would like to carry out more comparisons of the data I have received and start to create figures and graphs so that next week I can go over them with my advisor and see what direction to take the research and analysis in. I also want to update my github and get it caught up with all the work I have done.
* **Week 9**
The plan for this week is to carry on with my experiments and graphs so that I can draw more conlcusions from them. I would like to re-read the retina face paper aswell and start annotating my graphs and desrcibing what I see in a written format so that I can have some real evidence. Would also like to redo some of the histograms to use larger sized bins as grouping by single integer doesnt generealise well.
* **Week 10**
This week I plan on working on refining my results more by creating a scaled dataset. I plan on testing my results on different subsets of my dataset so I can test the robustness of my data set and produce an error metric. I want to research into the 4 algorithms so I can understand why it is that their results come out the way they do.
* **Week 11 [PROJECT WEEK]**
This week I plan on researching my 4 algorithms and completing paper summaries on them. I want to also look into more specific reasons why biased might exist. I would like to complete some research on the different datasets as well as I plan on including this in my disseration
* **Week 12 [PROJECT WEEK]** Status report submitted.
I plan on cleaning up my evaluation code to produce the specific graphs that are required, I also plan on cleaning up the code for the specific algorithms. I want to create a report which contains my figures and corresponding explanations of what is seen on them. 

## Winter break

## Spring Semester

* **Week 13**
This week I plan on researching into what specific facial features cause the MTCNN algorithm to perform worst on under represented faces than represented faces
* **Week 14**
This week I plan on continuing the research on the MTCNN algorithm and how changing the brightness and altering the images affects the results of the algorithm on underrepresented faces.
* **Week 15**
This week I plan on calculating the brightness for the photos and the contrast within the photos to see the link between these characteristics and performance
* **Week 16**
* **Week 17**
* **Week 19**
* **Week 20**
* **Week 21**
* **Week 22**
* **Week 23 [TERM ENDS]**
* **Week 24** Dissertation submission deadline and presentations.
